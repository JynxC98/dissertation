## Project Description

The goal of this project is to apply machine learning methods for portfolio optimisation. This involves creating an optimal portfolio of stocks and options, based on their respective returns and risks.

The project explores various machine learning algorithms to make predictions about future prices of stocks and options, and then uses these predictions to determine the optimal allocation of capital among the different assets.

This project was undertaken as part of the requirements for the MSc in Quantitative Finance degree at the University of Glasgow.
