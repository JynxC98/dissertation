 abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that a portfolio optimization model using the L$_1$ risk (mean absolute deviation risk) function can remove most of the difficulties associated with the classical Markowitz's model while maintaining its advantages over equilibrium models. In particular, the L$_1$ risk model leads to a linear program instead of a quadratic program, so that a large-scale optimization problem consisting of more than 1,000 stocks may be solved on a real time basis. Numerical experiments using the historical data of NIKKEI 225 stocks show that the L$_1$ risk model generates a portfolio quite similar to that of the Markowitz's model within a fraction of time required to solve the latter.},

    abstract = { Random forests (Breiman, 2001, Machine Learning 45: 5–32) is a statistical- or machine-learning algorithm for prediction. In this article, we introduce a corresponding new command, rforest. We overview the random forest algorithm and illustrate its use with two examples: The first example is a classification problem that predicts whether a credit card holder will default on his or her debt. The second example is a regression problem that predicts the logscaled number of shares of online news articles. We conclude with a discussion that summarizes key points demonstrated in the examples. }
